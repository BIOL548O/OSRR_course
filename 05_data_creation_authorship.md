##Data creation and authorship

**Goals for this lesson**

* Understand how authorship is allocated in scientific research products
* Discuss data sharing in the context of authorship

Today, we are going to discuss scientific authorship in the context of data creation, sharing and reuse. First we're going to discuss scientific authorship in general, and then we're going to extend what we've talked about to situations where data from a previously published source is being reused in a subsequent paper. It just so happens that the universe has provided some discussion materials for us through a twitter storm from last Friday. Yay for twitter storms! It all started with a New England Journal of Medicine [editorial](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1516564). As you probably guessed, I [took exception](https://practicaldatamanagement.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/a-fundamental-difference-of-opinion/) to the editorial on my blog.


So, how does data sharing fit into scientific authorship? Is using data produced by others [good science](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/11/07/the-one-true-route-to-good-science-is/)?

*NB: Both blog posts I've linked have some interesting counter-arguments and/or discussions in the comments section- be sure to skim through those as well in preparation for this discussion.*

##Becoming open scientists: what skills do you need?

**Goals for this lesson**

* Explore the technology available to support each step of the scientific workflow
* Discuss the impediments to adoption of new, 'better' tools
* Evaluate options for, and commit to, a collaborative writing platform that we will use for crafting out final paper

The traditional scientific workflow of designing an experiment, collecting data, analysing data, writing a paper have not changed dramatically in spirit since the advent of modern science. However, the tools availble in support of this workflow, and our ability to document our steps through this process has changed, mostly in the past 15 or so years with the increased connectivity offered by the internet. In this lesson, we will explore the different paths through the scientific workflow using different tools.

**Activity**
Create a list of collaborative writing platforms- we will evaluate the options in class. One student will write a reflective [blog post](https://osrrcourse.wordpress.com/) on our discussion, explaining our rationale about why we chose the platform we did.

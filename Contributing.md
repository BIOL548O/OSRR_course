##Guidelines for contributing##

1. Keep it friendly and respectful. A big motivation for this course is to help broaden participation in sciences through open science- don't be a jerk that creates a deliberately exclusionary environment. We're in this together, yo.
2. This repo is home to materials for an actual IRL offering of this course, that is underway from January to May, 2016, to a group of 6 mostly entomology students at Michigan State University. Thus, some material may be disproportionately insect focused. If you are afraid of bugs, feel free to fork the repo and build something that is pest free. This will be invaluable down the line when we're working on building more general teaching materials.
3. I really, really welcome PRs for content and cool links. Don't be shy. 
4. Non-linear development is cool and I want people to feel free to help out when they can, but I'll be most responsive to issues/PRs etc regarding classes scheduled to take place in the next week (see [schedule](https://github.com/cbahlai/OSRR_course/blob/master/schedule.md))  because of my IRL needs :)
